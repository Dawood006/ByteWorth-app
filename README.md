## Overview

ByteWorth is a machine-learning-powered application designed to estimate laptop prices based on their specifications. It features two predictive models:

1. **Random Forest Model** (Main App) - A robust and accurate model for price prediction.
2. **Linear Regression Model** (Alternative App) - A simpler model that underperforms compared to Random Forest.

Both applications are deployed using **Streamlit**, making them accessible via the links provided above.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `.devcontainer/` â†’ Configuration files for development container setups.
- `Linear model/` â†’ Contains the Linear Regression model app.
- `RF_model/` â†’ Houses the main Random Forest model app.
- `Web Scrape/` â†’ Scripts and notebooks for web scraping laptop data.
- `LICENSE` â†’ Project licensing details.
- `README.md` â†’ This documentation file.
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Main Application: Random Forest Model

ðŸ“Œ **Directory:** `RF_model/`  
ðŸ“Œ **Live Demo:** [Laptop Worth Predictor](https://laptoworth.streamlit.app/)  

This is the **primary** machine learning model used for predicting laptop prices. It utilizes a **Random Forest algorithm**, known for its superior performance in regression tasks. Users can enter laptop specifications to receive an estimated price.

**Key Files:**
- `RF_model.py` â†’ The main Streamlit application file.
- `rf_model.pkl` â†’ Pre-trained Random Forest model.
- `data/` â†’ Training dataset used for model development.

## Alternative Model: Linear Regression

ðŸ“Œ **Directory:** `Linear model/`  
ðŸ“Œ **Live Demo:** [Laptop Value Estimator](https://laptovaluex.streamlit.app/)  

This app implements a **Linear Regression** model for price prediction. However, due to its simplicity, it does not perform as well as the Random Forest model.

**Key Files:**
- `Linear_model.py` â†’ Streamlit app for Linear Regression.
- `linear_model.pkl` â†’ Pre-trained Linear Regression model.
- `data/` â†’ Training dataset.

## Web Scraping Module

ðŸ“Œ **Directory:** `Web Scrape/`  

A web scraping tool is included to gather real-world laptop pricing data for model training and updates from [Flipkart](www.flipkart.com)ðŸ›’

**Key Files:**
- `web_scrape.py` â†’ Python script to extract laptop pricing data.
- `laptop_data.csv` â†’ Collected dataset.

## Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
